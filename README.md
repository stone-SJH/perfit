You need to have RealSense device working(you may need to update your windows to windows8 or more), and connect to a PerFIT-server. I provide you a server with 59.78.22.247:5555, but you need to contact me with wy30123@163.com(stone) first. Or you may establish a Server with my PerFIT_Server code, if you'd like to do this, you need a java-1.8.0 and mysql environment.

Warning: our Server was written for linux, so it might have encoding error running in Windows.
